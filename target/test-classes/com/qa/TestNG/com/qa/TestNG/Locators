1)Xpath means the address of a particular element,so in future if your Xpath gets changed,your relative XPATH would change.
/html[1]/body[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[3]/td[1]/div[1]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[4]/a[1]--in future your path will change,then selenium won't be able to 
locate the element on a page and will give you "Element NOt Found" exception.
Relative Xpath is not recommended,instead you should use "Relative Xpath."

2)Linktext is available with link and should be available within "a" tag.

3)Partial Link text--is not recommended to use--is used in case of long link text,you can use partial link text---
like "How to pick a great id".


4)Class locator-Class name is not suitable or recommended because it can be duplicate.

Priority would be:
1)ID--in case ins ome complex applications,ID is getting changed,in that case ID won't work.--id is very fast because it will always be unique.
2)Xpath and CSS(if it's relative,should not be absolute)
3)Name--sometimes names might be duplicate,name is very fast


Xpath is also fast but make sure it should be Relative XPATH,once you have 15000 lines of code,in that case you will be failed in some 
of the test scripts.

CSS Selectors-CSS are basically used to give look and Feel,giving some styles,combining HTML to define a CSS.
CSS won't work for complex scenarios.
driver.findElementBy.cssSelector("Give Path"));

Xpath will work from parent to child,but CSS selector won't.

You should be use href tag to locate the elements on the page,it's not recommended.

Ways to Write XPATH:
//input[@type='text' and @name='username']
//a[contains(text(),'Features')]---by using contains--just make sure it will no search inside any attribute.
 //a[text()='Features']--this is basically a XPATH of link features.
 If there is more than 1 locators on the same name,exclude contains and use only text() method instead.
 
 Dynamic XPATH---Forward direction.
 //div[@class='dropdown']//button[@type='button' and @class='btn btn-secondary dropdown-toggle' and @id='dropdownMenuButton']
//button[@id='dropdownMenuButton']

++preceding-sibling:
//a[text()='test2 test2']//parent::td[@class='datalistrow']//preceding-sibling::td[@class='datalistrow']//input

++parent & preceding-sibling:
//a[text()='test2 test2']//parent::td[@class='datalistrow']//preceding-sibling::td[@class='datalistrow']//input[@name='contact_id']
